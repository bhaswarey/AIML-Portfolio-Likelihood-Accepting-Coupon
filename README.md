# 1 Business Understanding

## 1.1 Background

Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? 

Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? What  are the relevant charastics of the driver who is likely to accept a coupon?

**Figure 2 - Distribution of coupons by type**



Figure 2 provides a view of the distribution of the coupons offered to participants across the different types of business within the hospitality industry. The discribution in Figure 2 shows that the coupon campaign is skewed heavily towards the Coffee House businesses.
